    <h1>Rain It In</h1>

        <h2>Summary and Team Members</h2>
        <p>We plan to develop a physically-based rain simulation that dynamically adjusts to rain intensity and droplet size. The
        project will combine particle-based simulation with real-time rendering techniques to visually and physically simulate
        realistic rain behavior and interaction with surfaces including itself.</p>
        <h3>Team Members:</h3>
        <ul class="team-members">
            <li>Sophie Nazarian</li>
            <li>Andy Wang</li>
            <li>Dmytro Krukovskyi</li>

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Rain is a complex interaction between water and its surface. We want to simulate rain that adapts to current rain
        conditions: heavier rain should create bigger splashes or rain falling on objects should either bounce or drip based off
        of geometry and intensity. Drop physics, adjustable parameters and splash simulation would all be taken account when
        creating this project. We will treat each rain droplet as its own particle and apply the proper forces for it to behave as such. 
        Figuring out the math for splash and pooling effects might be challenging, but nothing a little physics cant handle.</p>

        <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <div class="goals-section">
            <h3>1. What We Plan to Deliver</h3>
            <p>We plan to deliver a real-time particle-based rain simulation with adjustable parameters such as rain intensity from
            light drizzle to heavy downpour and droplet size which affects fall speed and splash intensity. We also want to
            implement puddling/pooling based off the amount of water that has been rained. Lastly we want to show the interaction
            between the droplets and any object it would collide with if present.</p>
            
            <h3>2. What We Hope to Deliver</h3>
            <p>If things go well and we are ahead of schedule, we would like to add wind conditions as a parameter that would affect
            the rain such as wind direction and wind intensity. This will increase the rain interaction physics by the water falling.</p>
